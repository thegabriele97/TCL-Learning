ARGUMENTS
       -from from_list
              Collects only paths that start from the specified list of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or from startpoints clocked by
              the named clocks. Valid startpoints are clock pins of sequential
              devices and input pins of the design.

       -rise_from rise_from_list
              Same as the -from option, except that the path must start with a
              rising transition. If you specify a  clock  object,  the  option
              selects startpoints clocked by the named clock and launched by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_from fall_from_list
              Same  as  the -rise_from option, except that the path must start
              with a falling transition.

       -to to_list
              Collects only paths that end at  the  specified  list  of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or at endpoints clocked by the
              named clocks. Valid endpoints are data input pins of  sequential
              devices and output pins of the design.

              Due to the infrastructure of the timing analyzer, the -to option
              runs more efficiently than the -from option. As a  result,  end-
              point-oriented  path  gathering  (based on using the -to option)
              outperforms equivalent startpoint-oriented path gathering (based
              on using the -from option).

       -rise_to rise_to_list
              Same  as the -to option, except that the path data must end with
              a rising transition. If you specify a clock object,  the  option
              selects  endpoints  clocked by the named clock and captured by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_to fall_to_list
              Same  as the -rise_to option, except that the path data must end
              with a falling transition.

       -through through_list
              Collects only paths in which the data  goes  through  the  named
              pins,  ports,  cell  instances, or nets. You can use this option
              multiple times in a command.

              When a single -through list contains multiple objects, the  data
              path  can go through any one of the listed objects. When you use
              multiple -through options, the data path must meet each  of  the
              -through options in sequence.

              For  example,  the  following command gets a path that starts at
              A1, then passes through either B1 or B2, then passes through C1,
              and ends at D1.

                pt_shell> report_timing -from A1 -through {B1 B2} -through C1 -to D1

              If  advanced  analysis  through  transparent  latches is enabled
              (timing_enable_through_paths set to true), and the  pins  speci-
              fied  in  the  last through switch are latch loop breakers, then
              the timing paths collected are constrained by the worst  of  the
              closing edges at the latch or by a required value computed using
              logic downstream of the latch loop breaker.

       -rise_through rise_through_list
              Same as the -through option, except  that  it  applies  only  to
              paths with a rising transition at the specified objects.

       -fall_through fall_through_list
              Same  as  the  -through  option,  except that it applies only to
              paths with a falling transition at the specified objects.

       -exclude exclude_list
              Excludes all paths in which the data goes from, through,  or  to
              the  specified  list of pins, ports, nets, or cell instances; or
              excludes all paths belonging to the specified list of  path  tag
              sets.  It  checks only data paths (not clock paths) for excluded
              objects.

              Using the -exclude option can  result  in  significantly  longer
              runtimes.   To  reduce  the  runtime  impact,  use  this  option
              together with other  topological  restriction  options  such  as
              -from and -through.

              The -exclude option does not check borrowing paths considered by
              the -trace_latch_borrow option.

       -rise_exclude rise_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to rising  transi-
              tions at the named pins, ports, nets, or cell instances.

       -fall_exclude fall_exclude_list
              Same  as the -exclude option, but applies only to rising transi-
              tions at the named objects.

              You can use no more than one of the -exclude, -rise_exclude,  or
              -fall_exclude options in a command.

       -delay_type delay_type
              Specifies  the  type  of  path  delay constraint to consider for
              finding and sorting paths with the worst slack:
              o max (default) -- max delay (setup constraint)
              o min  -- min delay (hold constraint)
              o min_max  -- both min and max delay (stored min first, max sec-
                ond)
              o max_rise  -- max delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o max_fall  -- max delay, falling at data path endpoint
              o min_rise  -- min delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o min_fall  -- min delay, falling at data path endpoint

       -nworst paths_per_endpoint
              Collects up to the specified number of worst paths per endpoint.
              The default is 1. A larger value results in a larger  collection
              and more runtime. Allowed values are 1 to 2000000.

              If  you  set  -nworst  to any number greater than 1, the command
              automatically does the following:

              o Implicitly sets -max_paths equal to the -nworst setting if the
                -max_paths option is not used in the command, so that at least
                one set of multiple paths to an endpoint can be reported
              o   Implicitly    sets    -slack_lesser_than    0.0    if    the
                -slack_lesser_than  and  -slack_greater_than  options  are not
                used in the command, so that only violating paths are reported

       -max_paths max_path_count
              Collects up to the specified maximum total number of paths among
              all path groups. The default is equal to the -nworst setting, or
              1  if  the  -nworst  option is not used. Allowed values are 1 to
              2000000.

              If you set -max_paths to any number greater than 1, the  command
              implicitly sets -slack_lesser_than 0.0 if the -slack_lesser_than
              and -slack_greater_than options are not used in the command,  so
              that only violating paths are reported.

              The  -nworst  option  controls  the maximum number of paths col-
              lected per endpoint, whereas the -max_paths option controls  the
              overall total maximum number of paths collected.  The -max_paths
              setting should be at least as large as the -nworst  setting,  so
              by default the tool implicitly sets -max_paths to the same value
              as -nworst if you do not use the -max_paths option in  the  com-
              mand.

       -group path_group_list
              Collects  only  paths  that belong to the specified path groups.
              Path groups are created by the create_clock and group_path  com-
              mands.  Without  the -group option, the get_timing_paths command
              collects paths without considering path groups. For example, the
              get_timing_paths  command  alone creates a collection containing
              the single worst path in the  design,  whereas  get_timing_paths
              -group  [get_path_groups] creates a collection containing multi-
              ple paths, consisting of the single  worst  path  in  each  path
              group.

       -unique_pins
              Collects  only  the  single  worst timing path through any given
              sequence of pins. No other paths  are  collected  for  the  same
              sequence  of  pins  from startpoint to endpoint. For example, if
              the worst path starts with a rising edge at the first pin  of  a
              pin  sequence,  then  paths starting with a falling edge are not
              collected for that sequence of pins.

              For non-unate logic such as XOR gates, using this option greatly
              reduces  the number of paths collected because of the large num-
              ber of possible rising/falling edge  combinations  through  each
              sequence of pins.

              Using this option can require longer runtimes when used with the
              -nworst option because many paths must be analyzed to  find  the
              worst path through each pin sequence, but only the worst path is
              collected and counted  toward  the  total  number  of  requested
              paths.

       -slack_greater_than minimum_slack
              Collects  only paths with slack greater than the specified mini-
              mum_slack value; these paths have a negative slack  better  than
              the  specified  minimum_slack value (or a positive slack that is
              farther from causing a violation). This option is intended to be
              used  with the -slack_lesser_than option to collect paths within
              a specific range of slack.

       -slack_lesser_than maximum_slack
              Collects only paths with slack less  than  the  specified  maxi-
              mum_slack  value;  these  paths have a negative slack worse than
              the specified maximum_slack value (or a positive slack  that  is
              closer to causing a violation).

              By  default,  the report_timing command collects the single path
              with the worst slack; or if the -nworst or -max_paths option  is
              set  to  a value greater than 1, the command considers all paths
              with negative slack, as if -slack_lesser_than is set to 0.0.

              The -slack_lesser_than and -slack_greater_than  options  act  as
              filters  to restrict the paths that are collected, so the number
              of paths collected can be fewer than the number  specified  with
              the  -nworst and -max_paths options.  If no paths meet the slack
              criteria, no paths are collected.

       -ignore_register_feedback feedback_slack_cutoff
              Ignores noninverting timing loops that start and end at the same
              register pin that holds a value. To be ignored, the data-to-out-
              put arc and the output-to-data path must be either both  invert-
              ing  or both noninverting.  This option applies to minimum delay
              as well as maximum delay constraints. Paths are ignored only  if
              they  have a slack less than the specified feedback_slack_cutoff
              value.

              This option acts as a filter to restrict the paths that are col-
              lected,  so  the number of paths collected can be fewer than the
              number specified with the -nworst and -max_paths options.

       -include_hierarchical_pins
              Causes the collected paths to include points for the  hierarchi-
              cal  pins  crossed,  as  well  as all leaf pins in the path. The
              hierarchical pins are included only for documentation  purposes;
              the  report_timing command reports them as having zero incremen-
              tal delay and they do not affect the timing results.

       -trace_latch_borrow
              Controls the type of data collected for a path that starts at  a
              transparent  latch. If the path startpoint borrows from the pre-
              vious path segment, using this option causes the  path  data  to
              include the set of borrowing paths that lead up to the borrowing
              latch, starting with  a  nonborrowing  path  or  a  noninverting
              sequential  loop.  Each  path  segment is maintained separately,
              including the time borrowed and lent and the  endpoints  of  the
              path segment.

              Without  the  -trace_latch_borrow  option,  the command does not
              include upstream borrowing latches when in default latch  analy-
              sis mode or borrowing latch loop breakers when in advanced latch
              analysis mode (timing_enable_through_paths variable set to true)
              as path segments in the timing report.

       -trace_latch_forward
              Controls  the  type  of data collected for a path that ends at a
              transparent latch D pin. If advanced analysis through  transpar-
              ent  latches  is  enabled (timing_enable_through_paths is set to
              true) and this transparent latch D pin is constrained by a down-
              stream required time, this option causes the data to include the
              paths in the fanout of this D pin that  led  to  the  downstream
              required  constraint. These paths can include multiple path seg-
              ments whereby  the  constraint  is  the  result  of  propagating
              through  more  than  one  latch  constrained  by  the downstream
              required time. In this case, each  path  segment  is  maintained
              separately,  showing  the downstream required time for that path
              segment.

              Without the -trace_latch_forward option, the  command  does  not
              trace the path beyond the specified endpoint.

       -pba_mode none | path | exhaustive
              Specifies one of the following path-based timing analysis modes:

              o none (the default) - Disables path-based analysis and  enables
                ordinary graph-based analysis. This is the fastest mode.
              o  path  - Performs path-based analysis on paths after they have
                been gathered by graph-based analysis, producing more accurate
                timing results for those paths. To control the ordering of the
                paths (either by original graph-based  slack  or  recalculated
                path-based  slack),  set  the  pba_path_mode_sort_by_gba_slack
                variable.
              o exhaustive - Performs an  exhaustive  path-based  analysis  to
                determine  the  truly worst-case paths in the design.  This is
                the most accurate and most  computation-intensive  mode.   You
                cannot   use   the   exhaustive   mode   together   with   the
                -start_end_pair, -cover_design, or path_collection options.

              In ordinary graph-based (default) timing analysis, the tool con-
              siders both the worst arrival time and worst slew among all sig-
              nals feeding into a path, even when the worst arrival and  worst
              slew come from different signals.

              In  path-based  timing analysis, the tool considers each path in
              isolation from other paths, which eliminates impossible combina-
              tions  of worst slew and worst arrival, and similar combinations
              of effects such as crosstalk and CRPR. As a  result,  path-based
              analysis reduces pessimism and increases accuracy at the cost of
              more runtime.

       -start_end_type from_to_type
              Restricts the collection to one of four classes of  paths  based
              on the type of startpoint and endpoint:

              o reg_to_reg - from register to register

              o reg_to_out - from register to output port

              o in_to_reg - from input port to register

              o in_to_out - from input port to output port

              In  this  description,  "register" means any valid startpoint or
              endpoint that is not an input port,  output  port,  or  bidirec-
              tional  port,  even if not a sequential register. For example, a
              clock-gating check endpoint qualifies as  a  "register"  in  the
              in_to_reg  from-to  type. A bidirectional port qualifies as both
              an input port and an output port.

       -normalized_slack
              Collects and sorts paths using normalized slack instead of abso-
              lute slack. Normalized slack is the absolute slack divided by an
              idealized maximum allowable  propagation  delay  (typically  the
              clock  period).  To  use  this option, the timing update must be
              performed while the timing_enable_normalized_slack  variable  is
              set to true.

       -start_end_pair
              Collects the worst path for each startpoint-endpoint pair in the
              design, including all  violating  startpoint-endpoint  pairs  by
              default,  or all startpoint-endpoint pairs with slack worse than
              the value specified by the  -slack_lesser_than  option  if  that
              option  is  used.  The  number  of paths collected is limited to
              2000000.

              The -start_end_pair option overrides  the  default  behavior  of
              collecting  only  the  single worst path in the design. Instead,
              the command collects the worst timing  path  of  each  violating
              startpoint-endpoint  pair, which can result in a very large col-
              lection and long runtimes. (Note that the Design Compiler and IC
              Compiler  tools  differ  from  this  behavior  by respecting the
              default limits on the number of paths collected and by  allowing
              usage of the -nworst and -max_paths with -start_end_pair.)

              To  limit the collection size and runtime to reasonable amounts,
              use the -slack_lesser_than option and specify a slack limit that
              is  only  slightly  greater  than the worst slack in the design.
              You can also restrict the scope of the  analysis  by  using  the
              -from,   -to,   and   similar   options.   You  cannot  use  the
              -start_end_pair   option   with   the    -nworst,    -max_paths,
              -unique_pins,  -slack_greater_than, or -ignore_register_feedback
              options.

              Using the -start_end_pair option requires any -from, -rise_from,
              or  -fall_from  option to specify only valid timing startpoints,
              and any -to, -rise_to, or -fall_to option to specify only  valid
              timing  endpoints;  wildcard  characters  that  specify  invalid
              startpoints or endpoints are not allowed. In  other  words,  the
              timing_report_always_use_valid_start_end_points    variable   is
              treated as set to true, irrespective of its actual setting.

              The -start_end_pair option sorts the paths first by endpoint and
              then  by  slack, with the paths sharing the same endpoint stored
              together in order of increasing slack.

       -cover_design
              Collects the worst  path  through  each  violating  pin  in  the
              design, so that the collected paths cover every violating pin in
              the design. A pin is deemed to be violating if its slack is less
              than   zero,   or   less  than  the  value  specified  with  the
              -slack_lesser_than option if that option is used. The slack of a
              pin  is  the  worst  slack  among  all paths that start at, pass
              through, or end on that pin. The maximum number  of  paths  col-
              lected is 2000000.

              You  can perform path-based analysis on the generated collection
              to get path-based accuracy that covers all known violating  pins
              in  the  design,  without  the runtime cost of performing a full
              exhaustive path-based analysis.

              The following options cannot be used with -cover_design:

              -nworst
              -max_paths
              -unique_pins
              -ignore_register_feedback
              -start_end_pair
              -pba_mode exhaustive
              path_collection

       -cover_through through_list
              Collects the single worst violating path  through  each  of  the
              named  pins,  ports,  cell  instances, and nets. Only paths with
              negative slack are collected (or with slack less than the  value
              specified by the -slack_lesser_than option, if used).

              The  number of paths collected is less than or equal to the num-
              ber of objects in the through_list. Fewer paths are collected if
              there  are  no  violating  paths  through the objects, or if the
              worst path through one object is the  same  as  the  worst  path
              through another object.

              The following options cannot be used with -cover_through:

              -nworst
              -max_paths
              -through / -rise_through / -fall_through
              -exclude / -rise_exclude / -fall_exclude
              -unique_pins
              -ignore_register_feedback
              -start_end_pair
              -pba_mode exhaustive
              path_collection

       -dont_merge_duplicates
              Prevents  the merging of duplicate paths across multiple scenar-
              ios when the PrimeTime tool is invoked with the  -multi_scenario
              option.

              By  default,  when  the  same path is collected in more than one
              scenario, the tool keeps only the single most critical  instance
              of that path in the merged collection.

              If  you  use  this  option,  the  tool  does not merge duplicate
              instances of the same path, but instead collects the most criti-
              cal instances of the path from all scenarios. Because the number
              of paths collected might  limited  by  -nworst,  -max_paths,  or
              other  command options, the resulting merged collection might be
              more focused on a portion of the design that is critical in mul-
              tiple  scenarios,  and  less  evenly spread out across different
              portions of design.

       -pre_commands pre_command_string
              Specifies a list of commands, separated  by  semicolons,  to  be
              executed  in  the worker (slave) context before execution of the
              get_timing_paths command. This option is available only  if  you
              invoke  the  PrimeTime tool with the -multi_scenario option. The
              maximum size of a command is 1000 characters.

       -post_commands post_command_string
              This option is like the -pre_commands option,  except  that  the
              commands  are  executed  after  (instead of before) the get_tim-
              ing_paths command.

       -path_type format
              Specifies the types of data points stored for each path  in  the
              path  collection.  Use the -path_type full_clock_expanded option
              to include clock path points leading up the launch  and  capture
              points,  including points leading up to generated clocks. Other-
              wise, omit the -path_type option to exclude  clock  path  points
              from  the path collection.  You can query the data points in the
              collection  as  path  attributes  or  report   them   with   the
              report_timing command.

              Note  that the report_timing command supports several -path_type
              format options, whereas the get_timing_paths command  only  sup-
              ports  full_clock_expanded. If you enter the -path_type argument
              as f or full or full_clock, the get_timing_paths command  inter-
              prets it as full_clock_expanded.

       -attributes attribute_list
              Specifies  the  attributes  to  be returned to the master from a
              slave collection.  By default, a slave collection  returns  only
              the  full_name,  scenario_name,  and object_class attributes. To
              control the amount of data retrieved from the  slave,  use  this
              option  together  with  the  set_distributed_parameters -collec-
              tion_levels command.

              The -attributes option is  available  only  if  you  invoke  the
              PrimeTime tool with the -multi_scenario option.

       -tag_paths_filtered_by_pba tag_name
              When  used  with  the -pba_mode path option, the -tag_paths_fil-
              tered_by_pba option causes tagging of all paths originally found
              by  path-based analysis and later discarded by path-based analy-
              sis, using the specified tag name.  In  future  get_timing_paths
              and  report_timing  commands,  you  can exclude the tagged paths
              from further analysis by specifying the tag name as an  argument
              to the -exclude option.

       path_collection
              Performs  path-based analysis on the specified paths and returns
              a new path collection.  You can use this option  only  with  the
              -pba_mode  path  option.  This option is mutually exclusive with
              options that control the selection of paths to collect.

DESCRIPTION
       The get_timing_paths command creates a collection of paths  for  custom
       reporting  or  other  operations.  Most of the get_timing_paths command
       options are shared by report_timing, and the behavior of  these  shared
       options  is  identical.  The  order  in  which  paths are returned from
       get_timing_paths matches the reported timing path order of  report_tim-
       ing.

       You  can  pass the generated collection directly to another command, or
       you can set a variable to the collection for later reporting. For exam-
       ple,

       pt_shell> sizeof_collection [get_timing_paths -nworst 4 -max_paths 20]
       Warning: report_timing has satisfied the max_paths criteria. ...
       20

       pt_shell> set mypaths [get_timing_paths -nworst 4 -max_paths 20]
       Warning: report_timing has satisfied the max_paths criteria. ...
       Information: Defining new variable 'mypaths'. (CMD-041)
        ...
       pt_shell> sizeof_collection $mypaths
       20
       pt_shell> get_attribute $mypaths slack
       -1.157432 -0.987188 -0.984205 -0.971914 -0.968931 -0.873521 ...
       pt_shell> report_timing $mypaths
       (20 path timing reports displayed)

       To iterate over the paths in the collection, use the foreach_in_collec-
       tion  command.   To   obtain   information   about   paths,   use   the
       get_attribute, report_attribute, and collection commands. To get a list
       of timing path attributes, use the following command:

         pt_shell> list_attributes -application -class timing_path
          ...
         Attribute Name             Object        Type       Properties  Constraints
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
         arrival                    timing_path   float      A
         capture_clock_paths        timing_path   collection A
         clock_uncertainty          timing_path   float      A
         close_edge_adjustment      timing_path   float      A
         common_path_pessimism      timing_path   float      A
          ...

       User-defined attributes can be created for timing paths and set on spe-
       cific    timing    paths    with    the    define_user_attribute    and
       set_user_attribute commands.  To be queried, the attribute must be  set
       on  a timing path collection that has been set to a variable, for exam-
       ple,
         pt_shell> define_user_attribute -classes timing_path -type boolean is_special
         pt_shell> set mypath [get_timing_paths ...]
         pt_shell> set_user_attribute -class timing_path $mypath is_special true
         pt_shell> get_attribute $mypath is_special
         true
       This behavior differs from user attributes set on other  objects,  such
       as  pins, which allow user attributes to be set and queried directly in
       the design (not stored in a collection variable).

       The get_timing_paths command constructs a  new  timing  path  at  every
       invocation  so two timing paths derived from identical get_timing_paths
       commands and stored in two different collection variables do not  share
       the same user attributes.  For example,
         pt_shell> define_user_attribute comment -type string -class timing_path
         pt_shell> set p1 [get_timing_paths]
         pt_shell> set p2 [get_timing_paths]
         pt_shell> set_user_attribute $p1 comment "Hello world"
         pt_shell> get_attribute $p1 comment
         Hello world
         pt_shell> get_attribute $p2 comment
         Warning: Attribute 'comment' does not exist on timing_path 'path' (ATTR-3)

       One attribute of a timing path is the points collection. A point corre-
       sponds to a pin or port along the path. Iterate  through  these  points
       with  the  foreach_in_collection command and collect attributes on them
       by using the get_attribute command.  To  get  a  list  of  timing  path
       attributes, use the following command:

         pt_shell> list_attributes -application -class timing_point
          ...
         Attribute Name              Object         Type     Properties  Constraints
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
         annotated_delay_delta       timing_point   float    A
         annotated_delta_transition  timing_point   float    A
         aocvm_coefficient           timing_point   float    A
         applied_derate              timing_point   float    A
         arrival                     timing_point   float    A
          ...

       For  information about creating collections and iterating over the ele-
       ments of a collection, see the examples in the EXAMPLES section and the
       man pages of the collections and foreach_in_collection commands.

       To  report the dominant and overridden timing exceptions related to the
       timing path, use the report_timing command with the -exceptions option.
       To  get  more  information about the exceptions that apply to the path,
       you can create a path collection with the get_timing_paths command  and
       query the timing path attributes:

         Attribute                         Possible Reason
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         dominant_exception                false_path / min_max_delay /
                                           multicycle_path
         startpoint_unconstrained_reason   no_launch_clock / dangling_start_point /
                                           fanout_of_disabled
         endpoint_unconstrained_reason     no_capture_clock / dangling_end_point /
                                           fanin_of_disabled

EXAMPLES
       You can find some detailed examples of custom timing reports in:

         $SYNOPSYS_ROOT/auxx/pt/examples/tcl

       where $SYNOPSYS_ROOT is the installation directory for PrimeTime.

       The following procedure reports the startpoint name, endpoint name, and
       the slack of the worst path in each path group.

         proc custom_report_worst_path_per_group {} {
           echo [format "%-20s %-20s %7s" "From" "To" "Slack"]
           echo "--------------------------------------------------------"
           foreach_in_collection path [get_timing_paths] {
             set slack [get_attribute $path slack]
             set startpoint [get_attribute $path startpoint]
             set endpoint [get_attribute $path endpoint]
             echo [format "%-20s %-20s %s" [get_attribute $startpoint full_name] \
               [get_attribute $endpoint full_name] $slack]
           }
         }

         pt_shell> custom_report_worst_path_per_group

       If  you use the -pba_mode option, path recalculation (path-based analy-
       sis) is used during the path search, and the worst  recalculated  paths
       meeting  your  criteria  are returned. This option requires that a path
       search to be performed to ensure that the paths  being  returned  truly
       are  the  worst  paths. The additional runtime required for this option
       depends on the amount of timing improvement resulting  from  path-based
       analysis. As the timing improvement from path-based analysis increases,
       the runtime for the path search increases.  Large  -nworst  values  can
       significantly increase the time needed for the search.

       To see the worst path in the design with path-based analysis applied:

         pt_shell> report_timing [get_timing_paths -pba_mode exhaustive]

       To  report  all  endpoints  in  the design which fail after considering
       path-based analysis:

         pt_shell> set mypaths [get_timing_paths -pba_mode exhaustive \
                     -slack_lesser_than 0 -max_paths 1000]
